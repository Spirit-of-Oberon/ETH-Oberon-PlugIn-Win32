developments, updates and applications must be marked "based on Oberon".

(4) Modifications by the Licensee are to be clearly identified.

the rights granted in Article 2. There shall be no right to distribute those
products which have been produced in violation of this contract.

(1) The Institute does not assume any liability for damage directly or 
indirectly caused by the application of the source code.

(2) If a third party takes legal action based on infringement of its 
protective rights by the Licensee's use of the source code, the contract
party sued must immediately notify the other contract party. The Licensee is
not entitled to conclude a settlement without the expressive and written 
consent of the Institute.

of the license.
